				<h1>Family Life</h1>
				<p>Mae Wu was born on the beautiful coastal country of Malaysia surrounded by food stalls on every street representing each ethnicity popular dishes. Years later at 7 years old she moved to Hong Kong where she was surrounded by even more delicious food dishes. Hong Kong cuisine is primarily influenced by a mixture of Cantonese, European and other asian styles. There she met her husband, Kong Wu, and had three boys. Being a factory worker sewing clothing and her husband in the factory making plastic, they knew they needed to move to the United States to have a better life for her children.</p>

				<h1>Restaurant History</h1>
				<p>Mae and her family arrived in Long Beach, California with all their belongs and the drive to open their dream restaurant. A restaurant that will bring the culture of Hong Kong to the United States. After a couple of years of saving money with her still being a seamstress and Kong, being a butcher at their local street market, they were able to put a downpayment in 1996 located on 364 San Antonio Drive, Long Beach. After 10 years, unfortunately, they needed to move into a different location. Still driven to keep their dream alive, they found a new place on Carson and Atlantic a few blocks away. The building underwent major remodeling and renovations since it was originally a gym. With a better location and bigger dining space, it wasn’t hard for them to adjust to a new place.</p>
				<p>Throughout their time managing the restaurant, they wanted to maintain the tradition with the family for this reason they would have their three children Kenny, David and Wally helped out at the restaurant after school and the weekend as waiters. After graduating from college and Kong passing away, the boys took up major roles to keep the restaurant in the family as the managers. Mae was able to retire in 2004 but stills come to the restaurant every day to see her loyal customers and appreciate her and her late husband’s dream come alive.</p>
