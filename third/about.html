			<p>Mae Wu was born in Malaysia, Asia with her six siblings. Mae went to China in 1949 and met her husband Kong there and they married each other. Together, they moved to California in 1973.
			Mae's first job was sewing in the factory which she then continued doing after she moved to California. Kong's job was being a butcher in the market on 20th street called Hansen Market. 
			Mae and Kong originally had a restaurant on 364 San Antonio Drive (street) 10 years before 1996. They had to close the place down because the renter wanted to use the property.
			After that, on May 31, 1996 on Carson and Atlantic Mae and Kong bought the property which was originally a gym and remodeled it to become what is Panda Garden today in Long Beach.
			They liked the property for its space and its visibility for people to see their restaurant since it is at the corner of the street. At the restaurant, they decided to sell food which was similar to what Hong Kong has.
			At the restaurant, the children would help after school as waiters/waitresses. When the kids would be at school the usual work hours would be from 11am-9pm.
			After her children graduated college, they took over the business in 2004. Until last year, Kong Yu Chang, Kong Yu Han, and Kong Yu Ming worked from the beginning and Kong Yu Ming retired last year.
